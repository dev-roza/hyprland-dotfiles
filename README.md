# Rex's Hyprland Dotfiles

I haven't made an install script (yet), but if you're looking to use these you probably have some knowledge on how to setup window managers in your system. Just copy the folders into their respective locations and have fun! You can contact me through discord if you have any problems: Rex2.0#4488

# Dependencies:
The ones I remember at least.
```sh
sddm swww alacritty micro catppuccin-gtk-theme-latte catppuccin-gtk-theme-mocha catppuccin-cursors-latte catppuccin-cursors-mocha rofi playerctl
